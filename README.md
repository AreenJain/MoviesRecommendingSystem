  <h1>Movie Recommender System Project</h1>

  <p>This is a content-based and director-based movie recommender system trained on a dataset containing 10,000 movies. It is an end-to-end machine learning project with a GUI web application that recommends movies using cosine similarity.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content-Based Filtering:</strong> Recommends movies based on similarity to other movies in terms of content features such as plot keywords, genres, and directors.</li>
    <li><strong>Director-Based Filtering:</strong> Considers the directors of movies as a criterion for recommending similar movies.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> Utilizes cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies and recommend the most similar ones.</li>
    <li><strong>End-to-End Project:</strong> Includes data preprocessing, model training, web application development, and deployment.</li>
    <li><strong>GUI Web Application:</strong> Provides an interactive user interface for users to input preferences and receive movie recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Numpy: Library for numerical computing and array operations.</li>
    <li>Pandas: Data manipulation library for handling and analyzing structured data.</li>
    <li>Scikit-Learn (Sk-Learn): Python machine learning library for building recommendation systems.</li>
    <li>NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and analysis.</li>
    <li>Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications for machine learning projects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>To get started with this project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Set up the Python environment and install the required dependencies.</li>
    <li>Preprocess the movie dataset and train the recommendation model.</li>
    <li>Develop the Streamlit web application for the movie recommender system.</li>
